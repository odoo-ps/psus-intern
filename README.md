## Product Configuration with Variants

Product configurator that calculates part numbers and prices based
on a set of inputs given by a user. If the product configured doesn't
exist in the system, a new product with the specifications will be
added and a unique part number will be generated. Its price will be
calculated using deltas in the attribute values. If the product does
exist in the system, it will retrieve the information from the system
and return that product instead.
