## Mass Timesheet Validation Button Assigns Access Levels

Timesheets are subject to 3 stages of approval, from the
project leader, project manager, and then the timesheet
approver. Each approver will be able to mass validate the
given timesheets in tree view when it is submitted to them
consecutively. Once the timesheets are approved by all
three approvers, only then can it be processed for invoicing.

This process works for employee timesheets as well as expense
report submissions.
