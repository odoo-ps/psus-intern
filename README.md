## Mass Timesheet Validation Button Assigns Access Levels

Employee timesheets are now approved in 3 stages:
- Project Leader Approval
- Project Manager Approval
- Timesheet Approver Approval
This extension oversees the workflow by automatically sending the
timesheets onto the next stage when it is approved to continue.
Once the time sheet is approved by all three stages, the timesheet
entry is only then process for invoicing. If at any time the entry
was rejected, the employee is notified and must make corrections
before resubmitting. The process is similar to any expenses.

In addition, a mass validate button is implemented in tree view for
easier access.
