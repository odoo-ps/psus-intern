## Job Numbers and Plant Codes

On sales orders, a job number will be generated from a user
chosen prefix and an Odoo-handled sequence. Once the record
is saved, the job number will be saved and associated with
the record.

On the customer form, a plant code will be generated using
the customer's company name and an Odoo-handled sequence
when their sales order has been confirmed. It will be saved
once the sales order is confirmed.
